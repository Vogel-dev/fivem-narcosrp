Gamemode developed on the FiveM platform, utilizing Lua for the majority of resources and scripts. Player panels and interfaces were created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The resources are connected to a MySQL database. The gamemode was created and developed by me in 2021. 

We were the first server in Poland to feature the Liberty City map from GTA IV. The resources from the launch of this map have been included in the repository for easy access and use. 

You are permitted to use code snippets or the entire gamemode to create your own servers. However, please refrain from removing my attribution from the asset descriptions.


## Repository content

* All Lua scripts used on the server
* Player panels and interfaces developed using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
* MySQL database structure
* Server configuration file with properly set permissions.
* A file suitable for running the entire gamemode on a VPS (Virtual Private Server)
* File responsible for the automatic execution of scripts at server startup
* Configuration files specifically tailored for the Liberty City map
* Additional required modules

## Repository does not contain:

* Forum code or synchronization of the game account with the forum account
* Vehicle models
* Clothing models for in-game characters.
* Models specifically designed for the Liberty City map.

### Support
